Tidal Cycles is a composite software. To upgrade it, it is recommended to upgrade everything along with the pattern library (including your text editor and the SuperDirt audio engine). Each time a new version of Tidal is released, a new version of SuperDirt will likely follow, etc.

## Library 

Upgrade tidal with the following from a terminal window (**Linux**/**MacOS**/**Windows**):

```shell
cabal update
cabal install tidal --lib
```

(If you're using an older version of haskell you might have to remove the `--lib` off the above command.)

## Editor plugin

Your text editor might refer to the Tidal Cycles plugin as an *extension* or as a *package*.
More information about ways to update your favorite text editor [here](TODO: link editor page).

## SuperDirt

To upgrade the SuperDirt sound synthesiser/sampler, open SuperCollider, and run the following command in the interactive editor:

```c
Quarks.update("SuperDirt")
```

You'll need to recompile the class library. You can do this either by simply restarting the software or via the *Recompile class library* entry on the *Language* top-bar menu.
