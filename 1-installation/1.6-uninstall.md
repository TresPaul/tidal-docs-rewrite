Tidal Cycles does not provide an easy uninstaller. To uninstall Tidal you will need to:
1. Uninstall SuperDirt and SuperCollider (if you are not already using it for another purpose).
2. Uninstall the Tidal library and the GHC compiler.

## Linux

There are multiple ways of installing Tidal depending on the distribution you are using.
Here are some tips you can use to locate all the components that are part of the Tidal install.

### Using whereis

Type `whereis scide sclang scsynth` in a terminal path to get the path to **SuperCollider** binaries.

### SuperDirt Quark

1. Open SuperCollider. In the `File` menu, click on `Open user support directory`. This menu will take you where SuperDirt is currently installed on your computer.
2. Check in the `downloaded-quarks` for SuperDirt. Don't forget to uninstall the `Dirt-Samples` folder as well. It can be quite heavy (all the samples are located here).

### Uninstall stack

If you installed Tidal using Stack, you can use a dirty but simple solution to uninstall it.
Run `rm -rf $HOME/.stack`. This command will delete the hidden stack folder located in your root directory.

Stack will sometimes install a binary located here: `$HOME/.local/bin`. Delete it if you want.

:::warning
Double-check or triple-check the `rm -rf` command. This is a powerful tool that will delete things definitively. Use it with caution as it can be quite dangerous if you mess with it.

### Clean up cabal and GHC

To clean up `cabal` and `GHC` (user-installed packages), try running the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
rm ~/.cabal ~/.ghc
```

## Windows

<!-- TODO: windows uninstall instructions -->

## MacOS

### Using uninstall-hs

Open a terminal window and type `uninstall-hs`. This command will delete many things Haskell related from your computer. 

### Uninstalling ghcup

If you installed Tidal using `ghcup`, you can try a hacky solution. Open a terminal window and paste `rm -rf ~/.ghcup`. This will delete the `.ghcup` hidden directory that was living in your root directory.

:::warning
Double-check or triple-check the `rm -rf` command. This is a powerful tool that will delete things definitively. Use it with caution as it can be quite dangerous if you mess with it.
