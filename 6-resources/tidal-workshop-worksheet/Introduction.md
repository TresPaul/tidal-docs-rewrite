Welcome to Tidal tutorial. This is designed to
be used as a worksheet during hands-on beginner/mixed workshops, and is
based on Tidalcycles version 0.9.10.

# Getting started

Once everything is installed, follow the following startup procedure
each time.

1.  Launch SuperDirt - In Supercollider, type 'SuperDirt.start' and run
    the code by holding down 'Ctrl' and pressing 'Enter' (while your
    cursor is on the same line as the code).
2.  Launch TidalCycles - In Atom, start a new file and save it with a
    ``` Haskell
    .tidal
    ```

    extension (e.g. \`examples.tidal\`)

## Making notes

``` Haskell
-- If you see a line of code with two dashes at the start like this, itâ€™s called a comment.
-- This is text that the computer will always ignore, so you can annotate your code.
```
