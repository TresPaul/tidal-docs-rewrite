# Combining numerical patterns

A core feature of Tidal is the ease in which two patterns can be
combined.

For example, these are two patterns being combined by adding together
their elements:

``` Haskell
"2 3" + "4 5 6"
```

The result of the above is equivalent to the pattern

``` Haskell
"6 [7 8] 9"
```

. But why?

Let's look closer. The two patterns line up over time like this:

      |  2  |  3  |
    + | 4 | 5 | 6 |

Unlike in previous versions of Tidal, when you combine two patterns in
this way, by default the structure now comes from *both patterns*. This
means you end up with *four* events, because the

``` Haskell
5
```

in the middle lines up both with the

``` Haskell
2
```

and the

``` Haskell
3
```

, and gets split in half between them. We can add the resulting pattern
to our table:

      |  2  |  3  |
    + | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    = | 6 |7|8| 9 |

You can see that the

``` Haskell
4
```

fits inside

``` Haskell
2
```

, so where they intersect, you get a new event equal to their sum

``` Haskell
6
```

.

Also see that the event with value

``` Haskell
5
```

is cut in half, to create two, shorter events. Half matches with the

``` Haskell
2
```

event and the other half matches with the

``` Haskell
3
```

event.

The fourth and final event comes from the intersection of

``` Haskell
3
```

and

``` Haskell
6
```

, giving a value of

``` Haskell
9
```

.

## Structure from the left

In previous versions of Tidal, the structure always came from the left.
You can still do this, but in this case using

``` Haskell
|+
```

.

For example:

``` Haskell
"2 3" |+ "4 5 6"
```

In the above example, you end up with structure from the first
(leftmost) pattern, like this:

       |  2  |  3  |
    |+ | 4 | 5 | 6 |
     = |  6  |  8  |

You can see the structure comes from the

``` Haskell
2
```

and

``` Haskell
3
```

.

``` Haskell
2
```

lines up with

``` Haskell
4
```

, and the start of

``` Haskell
3
```

is in

``` Haskell
5
```

, so you end up with

``` Haskell
2+4=6
```

and

``` Haskell
3+5=8
```

. The result is the equivalent of

``` Haskell
"6 8"
```

## Structure from the right

Likewise, you can take the structure from the right, with

``` Haskell
+|
```

. So

``` Haskell
"2
3" +| "4 5 6"
```

looks like:

       |  2  |  3  |
    +| | 4 | 5 | 6 |
     = | 6 | 7 | 9 |

The result is the equivalent of

``` Haskell
"6 7 9"
```

.

## All the operators

So far, we've just looked at

Note that

``` Haskell
+
```

is actually an alias for

``` Haskell
|+|
```

. So

``` Haskell
|+
```

is to take the structure from the left,

``` Haskell
+|
```

from the right, and

``` Haskell
|+|
```

or

``` Haskell
+
```

for both. Here are the basic operators you can use to combine numerical
patterns:

| Function     | Both                | Left    | Right   |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Add          | &#124;+&#124;(or +) | &#124;+ | +&#124; |
| Subtract     | &#124;-&#124;(or -) | &#124;- | -&#124; |
| Multiply     | &#124;*&#124;(or *) | &#124;* | *&#124; |
| Divide       | &#124;/&#124;(or /) | &#124;/ | /&#124; |
| Modulo       | &#124;%&#124;       | &#124;% | %&#124; |
| Left values  | &#124;<&#124;       | &#124;< | <&#124; |
| Right values | &#124;>&#124;       | &#124;> | >&#124; |

The last two are interesting, they let you only take values from one
side. So for example you could take structure from the left, but values
from the right with

``` Haskell
|>
```

, for example:

       |  2  |  3  |
    |> | 4 | 5 | 6 |
     = |  4  |  5  |

This is very similar to how

``` Haskell
|+|
```

used to work in the versions of tidal prior to 1.0.0 - it took structure
from the left, but values from the right. In fact,

``` Haskell
#
```

is an alias for

``` Haskell
|>
```

, mirroring the behaviour in previous versions of tidal.

# Combining control patterns

A control pattern (formerly known as a 'param pattern'), is a pattern
that's been given a control name. For example the number pattern

``` Haskell
"1 2 3"
```

can be turned into a control pattern like this

    speed "1 2 3"

.

Control patterns can be combined together in the same way as numerical
patterns. For example:

``` Haskell
d1 $ sound "drum" |+| n "1 2 3"
```

Nothing actually gets added together in the above, they're just combined
into the equivalent of

``` Haskell
d1 $ sound "drum:1 drum:2 drum:3"
```

. However if you specify the same numerical control more than once, then
their values \_will\_ be combined. For example:

``` Haskell
d1 $ sound "drum" |+| n "2 3" |+| n "4 5 6"
```

The above will be equivalent to:

``` Haskell
d1 $ sound "drum" |+| n "6 [7 8] 9"
```
