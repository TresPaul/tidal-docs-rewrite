## Description

![alex](alex.png)

There's now an online **Learning TidalCycles** course, lead by Alex McLean who created **Tidal**. It's based on around pre-recorded videos so you can join at any time. It was originally 'pay as you feel', but is now completely open access. If you find it helpful though, you can still contribute to the [TidalCycles open collective fund](https://opencollective.com/tidalcycles).
