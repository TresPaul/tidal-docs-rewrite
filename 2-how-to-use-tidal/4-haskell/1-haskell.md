**Tidal Cycles** is a domain-specific language made with the **Haskell** programming language. **Haskell** is a general-purpose, statically typed and purely functional programming language. Haskell had always been used, since its creation, by researchers/teachers, industrials, finance, etc... Haskell is renowned for some of its most distinctive features: type classes, insistance on the purely-functional programming paradigm, elegant syntax. 

**Haskell** can be compiled or interpreted. The **Glasgow Haskell Compiler** (a.k.a **GHC**) is the most widely used implementation. Tidal is using **GHCI**, the interpreted mode of **GHC** as a **REPL** to do *conversational programming* with the **Tidal** library. The text editor you are using when playing with **Tidal** acts as a "code-formatter" and "emitter", sending lines and statements directly to the **Haskell** interpreter.

**Haskell** is sometimes considered to be a difficult language for newcomers. In reality, the situation is more complex than it appears. **Haskell** can confuse some programmers that are accustomed to another programming paradigm: imperative, object-oriented, etc... However, if you don't know anything about programming yet, Haskell can be a wonderful language to learn.

## General resources

Many **Haskell** tutorials are focusing on lists. They are important to learn, but are not very often used in **Tidal**.
