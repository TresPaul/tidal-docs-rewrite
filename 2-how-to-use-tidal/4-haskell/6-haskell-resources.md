TidalCycles is a domain specific language made with the Haskell
programming language. Here's a place to collect recommended Haskell
resources.

# Tidal-specific resources

-   [Understanding the $](/wiki/Understanding_the_$ "wikilink")
-   [Type signatures](/wiki/Type_signatures "wikilink")
-   [What is a pattern?](/wiki/What_is_a_pattern? "wikilink")
-   [Tidal for
    programmers](https://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/~waldmann/etc/untutorial/tc/)

# Tidal-related resources

-   [NIL Haskell
    school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbelVBCWDk&list=PLyEzdf4cdMMHGqVnAzLV8eDXn6Ajj46JA) -
    video lectures by David Ogborn (not tidal-specific but by David who
    among other things works on Tidal and related projects)

# General resources

Note that a lot of Haskell tutorials focus on lists, which are important
to learn, but aren't used very often in Tidal.
